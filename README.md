# ITAS 192 Final Project

## Traditional Irish Music Randomizer with Wikipedia Search

## By: Christine Bergen

### Purpose of this project

Being a musician with a keen interest in Traditional Irish music, I wanted to provide users a way to randomly choose
a traditional Irish tune from the top 50 most popular tunes on a commonly used site for Irish Music: thesession.org.

With thousands of tunes out there, it can be very challenging to decide which tunes to learn next.
My website can help to direct the user towards a popular tune that would be worthwhile to learn.
This website will also provide some background information about the tune that is displayed via the Wikipedia
API.

### APIs used:

https://thesession.org/api<br/>
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php

### JS code stack

React JS Library: https://react.dev/<br/>
Anime JS Library: https://animejs.com

### Challenges & If I Had More Time...

Initially, after the random tune name was obtained, I wanted to be able to show a page from
thesession.org website that showed the sheet music. After some deliberation it was decided that it may be
fairly complicated, and that the current timeline for this project likely would not see this feature to completion.
I also attempted to add a YouTube search to the site, that searched for the top video using the name of the tune
obtained randomly. This proved problematic to access the information needed, so I decided to try the Wikipedia API, which
seemed to be implemented fairly seamlessly. If I had more time, I would have liked to work a bit more on getting the sheet music
to display or getting the YouTube API working.

### Resources

I did have some help from Chat GPT for troubleshooting some of the functions.<br/>
anime.js was another JS library used to create an animation when the wikipedia results are displayed.<br/>
https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/flag-ireland/ for the Ireland flag favicon<br/>
The landscape of Ireland inspired the colours used in the page.<br/>

### General Course Feedback

Overall this was a decent course. I definitely do not feel like I'm confident in any aspect of JS though. It's a pretty tough concept to grasp with no coding experience prior to last September. I would like to see more coding examples given in class that we all go through together. Being told to "refer to the slides" isn't very helpful, as the slides don't lay out the coding in the proper context. "Refer to the slides" format works well for HTML and CSS as they are extremely simple in the land of coding, but I think JS deserves a much deeper dive.
